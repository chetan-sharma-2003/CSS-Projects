            <h1 class="con1">Greatest Entrepreneur - Elon Musk</h1>
            <p class="con2">Elon Musk cofounded six companies including electric car maker Tesla, rocket producer SpaceX
                and tunneling startup Boring Company.He owns about 25% of Tesla between stock and options, but has
                pledged more than half his stock as collateral for loans.
                SpaceX, founded in 2002, is worth $127 billion after a funding round in May 2022; it quadrupled its
                value in three years.
                Boring Company, which aims to defeat traffic, raised $675 million in April 2022 at a $5.7 billion
                valuation.
                Twitter's board agreed to sell the company to Musk for $44 billion in April 2022, after he disclosed a
                9.1% stake and threatened a hostile takeover.
                The deal closed in October 2022 after Musk tried to back out and Twitter sued. Musk now owns an
                estimated 74% of the company.</p>
